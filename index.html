                        <p>
                            &emsp;Founded around the 9th century and 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena
                            Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin, Hogwarts was established in the Highlands
                            of Scotland to educate young wizards and witches as well as to keep students safe from
                            Muggle persecution. Theory has it that Rowena Ravenclaw came up with the name of Hogwarts
                            after dreaming of a warty hog that led her to a cliff by a lake. Since then, Hogwarts
                            educated most wizarding children with residence in Great Britain and Ireland, keeping its
                            location hidden from other wizarding schools and Muggles.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &emsp;Hogwarts is divided into four houses, each bearing the last name of its founder:
                            Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff. Throughout the
                            school year, the houses compete for the House Cup, gaining and losing points based on
                            actions such as performance in class and rule violations. The house with the highest
                            end-of-year total wins and has its colours displayed in the Great Hall for the following
                            school year.
